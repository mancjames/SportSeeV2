## Installation


### 1 - Installing the Back-End

Please follow the instructions in the below link to set up the back end in your local environment

https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

once installed, run the following command to launch the back-end on port 3000(default):

```yarn dev```

### 1 - Running locally

Open the file within visual studio code and open the solution of the project.

Configure the startup projects so SportSeeV2.Server runs first and sportseev2.client runs second. Press start and this should open the webpage to allow you to navigate around the site.

### 2 - Browse the website with different end-points

For purpose of this exercise, the only endpoints available in the application are '/user/1' and '/user/2'. 

Any other endpoints will lead to an error page. 

When the application first loads, it will lead to a landing page to allow you to pick a valid user through a link
